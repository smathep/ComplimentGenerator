Okay, well I guess I shouldn't complain because the rent's never due, but God knows as Robert's dog knows, all day long I think of things, but nothing seems to satisfy. Am I going insane, or what?!\nYou know,\n\"One thing you can't hide - is when you're crippled inside.\"\n But always keep in mind,\n\"All you need is love.\"\nAnd certainly,\n\"Don't carry the world upon your shoulders.\"\nYou know, no one's perfect. But,\n\"With every mistake, we must surely be learning.\"\nAlana, if you're having a big disagreement with someone close to you remember,\n\"Life is very short and there's no time for fussing and fighting my friend.\"\nAnd no matter what, always remember:\n\"The long and winding road that leads to home will never disappear.\"\n\"Take my advice: If you're feeling lazy and don't want to think of good quotes, use Google.\" - Dad")
insert_compliment('Mom', 'Your', "Remember that you are doing so much good in the children's lives. You are making a big difference. Think about how thankful and appreciative some of the parents have been for your help; suggestions and support. All the cute kids you get to play with and the progress they are making with your help.\n\n Remember how flexible this job is and you don't have anyone micro managing you and all the time spent working at Panera instead of working behind a boring desk.\n\nRemember how good it felt when you helped that sweet kid to use the potty.\n\nDo not put so much pressure on yourself for not making the goal for the month, as your supervisor is not making it a huge deal. You don't know if others are in the same boat. Remember all the good things your supervisor said to you about how good a job you are doing. They need you and the kids need you.\n\nWork on developing a \"thick skin\" and not let things people say bother you as it has in the past. See it as, you know yourself better than they do or take things as constructive criticism.\n\nFind time to drink water because it is important and will help you feel better. \n\nI am proud of you and love you very much!\n\nMom")
